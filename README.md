## Background & Goals
I heard about Advent of Code from a [friend](https://github.com/icicl) in 2018, but only really got into it in 2020 (consequently, I've been doing some of the 2015-2019 puzzles in my free time for the past year or so). My goals are as follows:
- *Complete* as many puzzles as I can *without* looking up any solutions or using any packages/libraries other than what is provided in the language's standard library.
- *Try* to attain at least 90% of stars for each given year (i.e. 45/50 stars for a given year).
- *Learn* more about different programming languages and improve my general programming and problem-solving skills.
