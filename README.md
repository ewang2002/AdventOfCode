## Notes

- I heard about Advent of Code from a friend in 2019, but only really got into it in 2020. My goal is to try to complete as many puzzles as I can *without* looking up any solutions or using any packages other than what is provided in the standard library.
- I want to use Advent of Code to *learn* more about different programming languages and improve my general programming skills. Consequently, my solutions may be less than ideal.
- This repository will be incomplete. I plan on doing these when I have both the free time and motivation to do so.

## Languages to Try

- Kotlin
- C
- Python
