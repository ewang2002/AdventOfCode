## Notes

- I heard about Advent of Code from a friend in 2019, but only really got into it in 2020. My goal is to try to complete as many puzzles as I can *without* looking up any solutions.
- Rather than having one repository per year (event), I decided to put everything into one repository; so, I basically combined my other three repositories into this one. However, I will keep up two of the original repositories (2018, 2020) as they do contain (substantial) progress that I've made. They are linked in the table above. 
- Overall, I want to use Advent of Code to *learn* more about different programming languages. I'm currently learning more about the Rust programming language, and plan to look into other programming languages like C and Python. Feel free to give feedback. 
- This repository will be incomplete. I plan on doing these when I have both the free time and motivation to do so.

## Languages to Try

- Kotlin
- C
- Python
