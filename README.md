## More Information
I heard about Advent of Code from a [friend](https://github.com/icicl) in 2018, but only really got into it in 2020 (consequently, I've been doing the 2015-2019 puzzles in my free time for the past year or so). My goals are as follows:
- *Complete* as many puzzles as I can *without* looking up any solutions or using any packages/libraries other than what is provided in the language's standard library.
- *Try* to attain at least 90% of stars for each given year (i.e. 45/50 stars for a given year).
- *Learn* more about different programming languages and improve my general programming and problem-solving skills.

A lot of my solutions may be less than ideal for various reasons. In particular, there may be a lot of:
- Brute-force or generally inefficient solutions.
- Not-so-idiomatic code (especially for Rust).
- Code that's hard to read or makes little sense.
- Me overcomplicating the problem.

**In general**, for any given solution (both part 1 and 2 of a given day):
- It *should* run in under 1 second (with full optimizations). 
- It *should* generally be readable.

If a solution takes longer than 30 seconds to run (again, with full optimizations), I will not use or post it. That being said, if you have any suggestions or feedback on how to improve a solution, please submit an issue describing your suggestions.

Finally, this repository will be incomplete. I plan on doing these when I have both the free time and motivation to do so. Note that if I can't figure out how to do a problem in a reasonable time frame and the problem itself isn't interesting, I'll most likely skip it.
