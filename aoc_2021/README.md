# Advent Of Code 2021
My solutions to the [2021 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) puzzle questions.

## Language of Choice
- Rust

## Status

A ✔️ means that I completed the problem. An ❌ means that I saw the problem but did not solve it. A ❓ (or the entire day not being listed in the table below) means that I did not look at the problem yet.

## Note
I'm doing this Advent of Code so I can learn more about the Rust programming language (especially since I'm new to the language). Feedback on how I can improve my code (either logically or idiomatically) will be great.

That being said, I will do these questions when I feel like it; in other words, no guarantees that I'll finish these or do these questions on a daily basis.
