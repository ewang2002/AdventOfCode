# Advent Of Code 2020
My solutions to the [2020 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) questions.

## Language of Choice
- C# (.NET 5)

## Note
 Some questions are incomplete. Specifically, Day 19P2, Day 20P2, Day 21P1P2, Day 23P2, and Day 25P2. I plan on completing these problems later on (as I do want to take a break and work on other projects as well). 

 With that said, I absolutely enjoyed doing this year's Advent of Code questions. I learned that you actually don't need a computer science degree to do these problems. You just need to know the fundamentals of programming (variables, loops, operators), a programming language, and a few basic data structures (arrays, lists, dictionaries, and sets) -- and, of course, a little bit of creativity.

 I can't wait for AoC 2021. :) 

## Layout 
For each question, I will do the following. 

#### Stage 1: *Make It Work...*
I will try to do the question as fast as possible using what I know. In other words, I do not spend much time optimizing. 

These solutions can be found in the `AoC2020/Solutions` directory.

#### Stage 2: *...Then Make It Better.*
After I successfully submit a question, I will go back to my original solution and see what I could do to make it "better." 

In the case that I need to revise my code, I will put the revised solution in the `AoC2020/Revised` directory.
