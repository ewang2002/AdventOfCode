# Scratch Files
This folder contains some random scratch code. These are usually written in JavaScript or TypeScript. I occasionally write some scratch code to get an idea of what I should be implementing in Rust. In other words, think of the scratch code here as the *rough draft* and my Rust code as the *final draft*.

My actual Rust solution will most likely mimic the solution posted here.
